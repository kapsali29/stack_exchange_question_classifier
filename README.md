A stack exchange question classifier (Hackerank's problem)

## Stack Exchange
Stack Exchange is an information powerhouse, built on the power of crowdsourcing. It has 105 different topics and each topic has a library of questions which have been asked and answered by knowledgeable members of the StackExchange community. The topics are as diverse as travel, cooking, programming, engineering and photography.

We have hand-picked ten different topics (such as Electronics, Mathematics, Photography etc.) from Stack Exchange, and we provide you with a set of questions from these topics.

Given a question and an excerpt, your task is to identify which among the 10 topics it belongs to.
